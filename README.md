# video-background-site
Creating a beautiful, custom landing page using HTML, CSS with video as background (based on this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MgpE2DTTKA)

See result here https://codyfet.github.io/video-background-site/index.html

Most interesting css features from this tutorial (for me):

* `transition: 0.2s;` - for smooth movement of elements
* `object-fit: cover;` - for fitting video
* `mix-blend-mode: overlay;` - for creating cool visual effect for overlaying panel
* `letter-spacing: 2px;` - for creating interesting font effect when hover
* `filter: invert(1);` - for inversion color
* `transform: scale(0.5);` - for scaling icons (especially on hover)
